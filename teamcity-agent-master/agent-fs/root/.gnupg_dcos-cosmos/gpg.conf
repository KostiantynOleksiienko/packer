# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
# certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.
# This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
# Defaults to --no-require-cross-certification.  However for new
# installations it should be enabled.

# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
#
# Example HKP keyservers:
#      hkp://keys.gnupg.net
#
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
#
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
#
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.
# Note that most servers (with the notable exception of
# ldap://keyserver.pgp.com) synchronize changes with each other.  Note
# also that a single server name may actually point to multiple
# servers via DNS round-robin.  hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an example of
# such a "server", which spreads the load over a number of physical
# servers.  To see the IP address of the server actually used, you may use
# the "--keyserver-options debug".
